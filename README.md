# bela-grainsynth

This is the prototype of my granular synthesizer.
It was programmed in [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/) on a BeagleBone Black, equipped with a [Bela-Cape](https://eu.shop.bela.io/collections/bela-and-bela-mini/products/bela-cape).

Instructions and schematics will be added soon.
